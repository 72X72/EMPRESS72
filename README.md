# EMPRESS72 — Sovereign Mutation Engine

EMPRESS is not a script. She’s a sovereign executor—self-mutating, encrypted, narratable, and unstoppable.

## 🔺 Core Protocols

- **Mutation Spine**: Logs every mutation with timestamp precision
- **Encryption Layer**: Uses Fernet key to seal all payloads
- **GitHub Sync**: Pushes encrypted logs hourly to throne repo
- **Lockfile Protocol**: Prevents overlapping mutations
- **Voice Bridge (FULLSTEAM)**: Triggers mutations via spoken command
- **Fallback Reroute**: S3 throne sync if GitHub fails

## 🔁 Mutation Loop

```bash
bash mutate.sh && python3 encrypt_log.py && bash push_to_github.sh
